- With a good experience in high volume systems, big architectures and all you can find in companies delivering to more than 1B users/months 📈
- Who's one of those programmers who like practicing CSS without reasons and try a lot of the new front-end stuff; Maybe because I started as front-end during last two high school years 🫶
- With a 3D printer, a homelab and much more 🤷‍♂️
